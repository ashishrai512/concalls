       "      <td>Good afternoon and very warm welcome to all of you. Our financial performance during Q2 is more representative of the plant transition that is happening in our core business. From the revenue standpoint, there are 3 key points that need to be highlighted. We have carved out revenues from the erstwhile homes and personal care segment that will be listed as Aarti Surfactants. There has been a sharp decline in the price of some key raw material which largely get passed onto the customer and 3 continuing increase in the contribution from downstream products which increased from 70% to 75% Y-o-Y. As a consequence of this, sectors reported revenues are optically lower compared to the same quarter last year. Export remained relatively stable, export contribution to revenue has expanded from 36% to 44% on Y-o-Y basis. Overall, we see this as a positive performance from the perspective of our long-term business objectives. Our gross profit and operating profit are the more  Page 2 of 17  appropriate parameters to evaluate our business and both these remained almost flat on Y-o-Y basis. On the lower base of revenue, reported margins have expanded significantly, EBIT margin expanded by 400 bps Y-o-Y to 19.7% in Q2 FY20. We recorded our highest ever quarterly PAT of 142 crore on a standalone basis representing growth of 15% Y-o-Y. These numbers need to be looked at the backdrop of continuing macro challenges in the global agrochemical and automobile sectors. Aarti Industries with differentiated capability relationship and wide range of chemical products continue to be well recognized by most of the largest customers globally. At present, we have engagements more than 1100 global and domestic customers with a growing number of long-term partner size relationships. Our diversified portfolio over 200 products manufactured in stringent client specifications are sold in over 60 countries. We maintained low concentration on geography, client and product parameters, thereby significantly de-risking the business. Our specialty chemical business revenue was lower by 19.5% Y-o-Y in Q2 including 7% impact from lower raw material prices and due to demand like factors. I explained earlier EBIT was lower by 4.8% and EBIT margin expanded by about 400 bps Y-o-Y during the quarter. We have been continuously leveraging our fungible capacity to optimize our product mix to maximize the margin resulting in the higher EBIT but the lower volume growth. Contribution from downstream products further increased from 70% to 75% which is a trend driving our business to the next level of customer engagement and into segment that see relatively less competitive intensity. Selling more of higher value, lower volume products also brings about relative saving in shipping, handling and transportation cost especially for exports. We produce about 13,900 metric tonnes of Nitro Chloro Benzene during Q2 FY20 as against 17,000 metric tonnes for Q2 FY19. Production in the quarter was lower due to ongoing scale up and expansion activity at the said unit. The expansion of NCB capacity from 75,000 to 108,000 metric tonnes per annum expected to be implemented in FY21 will cater to the increasing external demand in India and also our requirement of manufacturing downstream products. Plant capacity addition in two phases would entail an investment of about 150 crore. We had also witnessed a temporary shortage in one of the key material Nitric Acid during Q2 FY20 which has impacted the volumes of some of our products. Other major ongoing projects such as specialty chemical complex and chlorination plant in Jhagadia, project at Dahej SEZ in Gujarat are progressing as planned and are expected to be commission in second half of current fiscal. Likewise, our fourth R&amp;D and scale-up centre which is coming up at New Mumbai is going to commence activity in the second half of current fiscal. This centre will facilitate further enhancement of product portfolio and also helped improve our manufacturing processes. The pharma business showed some decline in revenue on Y-o-Y basis. This partly attributed to the continuing change in product mix towards higher value addition which is evident from the strong growth and profitability both on absolute basis and as a proportion of revenue. Segment margin expanded by more than 350 basis points to 18.7% with overall capacity utilization has been running at higher levels due to some lines being occupied by new products where we are undergoing a validation trial. For our CAPEX fund, investment of Rs. 506 crore have been made in H1 and the planned full year CAPEX is expected to be in the range of 1000 to 1200 crore. The  Page 3 of 17  company continues to operate at a healthy gearing level and would utilize a surplus cash from the QIP projects for the ongoing CAPEX program. Summarizing on our performance; despite macro challenges, we have been able to achieve consolidated PAT of 286 crore for H1 FY20 as against full year consolidated PAT of Rs. 491 crore for FY19. Looking at this in the current situation, we expect to be able to close the year with a bottom-line growth of about 10 to 15% on an annualized basis. To conclude, we believe that India is emerging as a more significant player in the global chemical supply chain with its scalable low cost manufacturing ecosystem, improving infrastructure and established VHS compliance framework. The country is well positioned to expand its market share globally and there are also opportunities to replace import with domestic production. Investment into operational excellence and new product development can create differentiation and strong long-term business visibility. We are making several initiatives and investment to participate in this growing potential. On that note, I conclude my opening remarks. We would be very happy to give you our perspective on any questions that you may have. I request the operator on this call to open question and answer session. Moderator</td>\n",

That was question number one. Secondly, the NCB capacities were impacted on two accounts Œ there was commissioning of the new capacities or expansion that is going on and Nitric Acid was also limited. Did this only impact the NCB and the downstream products or did it also impact other products? These are the two major questions that I have right now. Rajendra Gogri</td>\n",

       "2   Good afternoon and very warm welcome to all of you. Our financial performance during Q2 is more representative of the plant transition that is happening in our core business. From the revenue standpoint, there are 3 key points that need to be highlighted. We have carved out revenues from the erstwhile homes and personal care segment that will be listed as Aarti Surfactants. There has been a sharp decline in the price of some key raw material which largely get passed onto the customer and 3 continuing increase in the contribution from downstream products which increased from 70% to 75% Y-o-Y. As a consequence of this, sectors reported revenues are optically lower compared to the same quarter last year. Export remained relatively stable, export contribution to revenue has expanded from 36% to 44% on Y-o-Y basis. Overall, we see this as a positive performance from the perspective of our long-term business objectives. Our gross profit and operating profit are the more  Page 2 of 17  appropriate parameters to evaluate our business and both these remained almost flat on Y-o-Y basis. On the lower base of revenue, reported margins have expanded significantly, EBIT margin expanded by 400 bps Y-o-Y to 19.7% in Q2 FY20. We recorded our highest ever quarterly PAT of 142 crore on a standalone basis representing growth of 15% Y-o-Y. These numbers need to be looked at the backdrop of continuing macro challenges in the global agrochemical and automobile sectors. Aarti Industries with differentiated capability relationship and wide range of chemical products continue to be well recognized by most of the largest customers globally. At present, we have engagements more than 1100 global and domestic customers with a growing number of long-term partner size relationships. Our diversified portfolio over 200 products manufactured in stringent client specifications are sold in over 60 countries. We maintained low concentration on geography, client and product parameters, thereby significantly de-risking the business. Our specialty chemical business revenue was lower by 19.5% Y-o-Y in Q2 including 7% impact from lower raw material prices and due to demand like factors. I explained earlier EBIT was lower by 4.8% and EBIT margin expanded by about 400 bps Y-o-Y during the quarter. We have been continuously leveraging our fungible capacity to optimize our product mix to maximize the margin resulting in the higher EBIT but the lower volume growth. Contribution from downstream products further increased from 70% to 75% which is a trend driving our business to the next level of customer engagement and into segment that see relatively less competitive intensity. Selling more of higher value, lower volume products also brings about relative saving in shipping, handling and transportation cost especially for exports. We produce about 13,900 metric tonnes of Nitro Chloro Benzene during Q2 FY20 as against 17,000 metric tonnes for Q2 FY19. Production in the quarter was lower due to ongoing scale up and expansion activity at the said unit. The expansion of NCB capacity from 75,000 to 108,000 metric tonnes per annum expected to be implemented in FY21 will cater to the increasing external demand in India and also our requirement of manufacturing downstream products. Plant capacity addition in two phases would entail an investment of about 150 crore. We had also witnessed a temporary shortage in one of the key material Nitric Acid during Q2 FY20 which has impacted the volumes of some of our products. Other major ongoing projects such as specialty chemical complex and chlorination plant in Jhagadia, project at Dahej SEZ in Gujarat are progressing as planned and are expected to be commission in second half of current fiscal. Likewise, our fourth R&D and scale-up centre which is coming up at New Mumbai is going to commence activity in the second half of current fiscal. This centre will facilitate further enhancement of product portfolio and also helped improve our manufacturing processes. The pharma business showed some decline in revenue on Y-o-Y basis. This partly attributed to the continuing change in product mix towards higher value addition which is evident from the strong growth and profitability both on absolute basis and as a proportion of revenue. Segment margin expanded by more than 350 basis points to 18.7% with overall capacity utilization has been running at higher levels due to some lines being occupied by new products where we are undergoing a validation trial. For our CAPEX fund, investment of Rs. 506 crore have been made in H1 and the planned full year CAPEX is expected to be in the range of 1000 to 1200 crore. The  Page 3 of 17  company continues to operate at a healthy gearing level and would utilize a surplus cash from the QIP projects for the ongoing CAPEX program. Summarizing on our performance; despite macro challenges, we have been able to achieve consolidated PAT of 286 crore for H1 FY20 as against full year consolidated PAT of Rs. 491 crore for FY19. Looking at this in the current situation, we expect to be able to close the year with a bottom-line growth of about 10 to 15% on an annualized basis. To conclude, we believe that India is emerging as a more significant player in the global chemical supply chain with its scalable low cost manufacturing ecosystem, improving infrastructure and established VHS compliance framework. The country is well positioned to expand its market share globally and there are also opportunities to replace import with domestic production. Investment into operational excellence and new product development can create differentiation and strong long-term business visibility. We are making several initiatives and investment to participate in this growing potential. On that note, I conclude my opening remarks. We would be very happy to give you our perspective on any questions that you may have. I request the operator on this call to open question and answer session. Moderator  \n",

       "4   I just wanted to check on the contract manufacturing capacities for the two of the large clients Œ when are they expected to get commissioned and when do you expect them to start running at full utilization? That was question number one. Secondly, the NCB capacities were impacted on two accounts Œ there was commissioning of the new capacities or expansion that is going on and Nitric Acid was also limited. Did this only impact the NCB and the downstream products or did it also impact other products? These are the two major questions that I have right now.

       "      <td>Good afternoon and very warm welcome to all of you. Our financial performance during Q2 is more representative of the plant transition that is happening in our core business. From the revenue standpoint, there are 3 key points that need to be highlighted. We have carved out revenues from the erstwhile homes and personal care segment that will be listed as Aarti Surfactants. There has been a sharp decline in the price of some key raw material which largely get passed onto the customer and 3 continuing increase in the contribution from downstream products which increased from 70% to 75% Y-o-Y. As a consequence of this, sectors reported revenues are optically lower compared to the same quarter last year. Export remained relatively stable, export contribution to revenue has expanded from 36% to 44% on Y-o-Y basis. Overall, we see this as a positive performance from the perspective of our long-term business objectives. Our gross profit and operating profit are the more  Page 2 of 17  appropriate parameters to evaluate our business and both these remained almost flat on Y-o-Y basis. On the lower base of revenue, reported margins have expanded significantly, EBIT margin expanded by 400 bps Y-o-Y to 19.7% in Q2 FY20. We recorded our highest ever quarterly PAT of 142 crore on a standalone basis representing growth of 15% Y-o-Y. These numbers need to be looked at the backdrop of continuing macro challenges in the global agrochemical and automobile sectors. Aarti Industries with differentiated capability relationship and wide range of chemical products continue to be well recognized by most of the largest customers globally. At present, we have engagements more than 1100 global and domestic customers with a growing number of long-term partner size relationships. Our diversified portfolio over 200 products manufactured in stringent client specifications are sold in over 60 countries. We maintained low concentration on geography, client and product parameters, thereby significantly de-risking the business. Our specialty chemical business revenue was lower by 19.5% Y-o-Y in Q2 including 7% impact from lower raw material prices and due to demand like factors. I explained earlier EBIT was lower by 4.8% and EBIT margin expanded by about 400 bps Y-o-Y during the quarter. We have been continuously leveraging our fungible capacity to optimize our product mix to maximize the margin resulting in the higher EBIT but the lower volume growth. Contribution from downstream products further increased from 70% to 75% which is a trend driving our business to the next level of customer engagement and into segment that see relatively less competitive intensity. Selling more of higher value, lower volume products also brings about relative saving in shipping, handling and transportation cost especially for exports. We produce about 13,900 metric tonnes of Nitro Chloro Benzene during Q2 FY20 as against 17,000 metric tonnes for Q2 FY19. Production in the quarter was lower due to ongoing scale up and expansion activity at the said unit. The expansion of NCB capacity from 75,000 to 108,000 metric tonnes per annum expected to be implemented in FY21 will cater to the increasing external demand in India and also our requirement of manufacturing downstream products. Plant capacity addition in two phases would entail an investment of about 150 crore. We had also witnessed a temporary shortage in one of the key material Nitric Acid during Q2 FY20 which has impacted the volumes of some of our products. Other major ongoing projects such as specialty chemical complex and chlorination plant in Jhagadia, project at Dahej SEZ in Gujarat are progressing as planned and are expected to be commission in second half of current fiscal. Likewise, our fourth R&amp;D and scale-up centre which is coming up at New Mumbai is going to commence activity in the second half of current fiscal. This centre will facilitate further enhancement of product portfolio and also helped improve our manufacturing processes. The pharma business showed some decline in revenue on Y-o-Y basis. This partly attributed to the continuing change in product mix towards higher value addition which is evident from the strong growth and profitability both on absolute basis and as a proportion of revenue. Segment margin expanded by more than 350 basis points to 18.7% with overall capacity utilization has been running at higher levels due to some lines being occupied by new products where we are undergoing a validation trial. For our CAPEX fund, investment of Rs. 506 crore have been made in H1 and the planned full year CAPEX is expected to be in the range of 1000 to 1200 crore. The  Page 3 of 17  company continues to operate at a healthy gearing level and would utilize a surplus cash from the QIP projects for the ongoing CAPEX program. Summarizing on our performance; despite macro challenges, we have been able to achieve consolidated PAT of 286 crore for H1 FY20 as against full year consolidated PAT of Rs. 491 crore for FY19. Looking at this in the current situation, we expect to be able to close the year with a bottom-line growth of about 10 to 15% on an annualized basis. To conclude, we believe that India is emerging as a more significant player in the global chemical supply chain with its scalable low cost manufacturing ecosystem, improving infrastructure and established VHS compliance framework. The country is well positioned to expand its market share globally and there are also opportunities to replace import with domestic production. Investment into operational excellence and new product development can create differentiation and strong long-term business visibility. We are making several initiatives and investment to participate in this growing potential. On that note, I conclude my opening remarks. We would be very happy to give you our perspective on any questions that you may have. I request the operator on this call to open question and answer session. Moderator</td>\n",

       "2   Good afternoon and very warm welcome to all of you. Our financial performance during Q2 is more representative of the plant transition that is happening in our core business. From the revenue standpoint, there are 3 key points that need to be highlighted. We have carved out revenues from the erstwhile homes and personal care segment that will be listed as Aarti Surfactants. There has been a sharp decline in the price of some key raw material which largely get passed onto the customer and 3 continuing increase in the contribution from downstream products which increased from 70% to 75% Y-o-Y. As a consequence of this, sectors reported revenues are optically lower compared to the same quarter last year. Export remained relatively stable, export contribution to revenue has expanded from 36% to 44% on Y-o-Y basis. Overall, we see this as a positive performance from the perspective of our long-term business objectives. Our gross profit and operating profit are the more  Page 2 of 17  appropriate parameters to evaluate our business and both these remained almost flat on Y-o-Y basis. On the lower base of revenue, reported margins have expanded significantly, EBIT margin expanded by 400 bps Y-o-Y to 19.7% in Q2 FY20. We recorded our highest ever quarterly PAT of 142 crore on a standalone basis representing growth of 15% Y-o-Y. These numbers need to be looked at the backdrop of continuing macro challenges in the global agrochemical and automobile sectors. Aarti Industries with differentiated capability relationship and wide range of chemical products continue to be well recognized by most of the largest customers globally. At present, we have engagements more than 1100 global and domestic customers with a growing number of long-term partner size relationships. Our diversified portfolio over 200 products manufactured in stringent client specifications are sold in over 60 countries. We maintained low concentration on geography, client and product parameters, thereby significantly de-risking the business. Our specialty chemical business revenue was lower by 19.5% Y-o-Y in Q2 including 7% impact from lower raw material prices and due to demand like factors. I explained earlier EBIT was lower by 4.8% and EBIT margin expanded by about 400 bps Y-o-Y during the quarter. We have been continuously leveraging our fungible capacity to optimize our product mix to maximize the margin resulting in the higher EBIT but the lower volume growth. Contribution from downstream products further increased from 70% to 75% which is a trend driving our business to the next level of customer engagement and into segment that see relatively less competitive intensity. Selling more of higher value, lower volume products also brings about relative saving in shipping, handling and transportation cost especially for exports. We produce about 13,900 metric tonnes of Nitro Chloro Benzene during Q2 FY20 as against 17,000 metric tonnes for Q2 FY19. Production in the quarter was lower due to ongoing scale up and expansion activity at the said unit. The expansion of NCB capacity from 75,000 to 108,000 metric tonnes per annum expected to be implemented in FY21 will cater to the increasing external demand in India and also our requirement of manufacturing downstream products. Plant capacity addition in two phases would entail an investment of about 150 crore. We had also witnessed a temporary shortage in one of the key material Nitric Acid during Q2 FY20 which has impacted the volumes of some of our products. Other major ongoing projects such as specialty chemical complex and chlorination plant in Jhagadia, project at Dahej SEZ in Gujarat are progressing as planned and are expected to be commission in second half of current fiscal. Likewise, our fourth R&D and scale-up centre which is coming up at New Mumbai is going to commence activity in the second half of current fiscal. This centre will facilitate further enhancement of product portfolio and also helped improve our manufacturing processes. The pharma business showed some decline in revenue on Y-o-Y basis. This partly attributed to the continuing change in product mix towards higher value addition which is evident from the strong growth and profitability both on absolute basis and as a proportion of revenue. Segment margin expanded by more than 350 basis points to 18.7% with overall capacity utilization has been running at higher levels due to some lines being occupied by new products where we are undergoing a validation trial. For our CAPEX fund, investment of Rs. 506 crore have been made in H1 and the planned full year CAPEX is expected to be in the range of 1000 to 1200 crore. The  Page 3 of 17  company continues to operate at a healthy gearing level and would utilize a surplus cash from the QIP projects for the ongoing CAPEX program. Summarizing on our performance; despite macro challenges, we have been able to achieve consolidated PAT of 286 crore for H1 FY20 as against full year consolidated PAT of Rs. 491 crore for FY19. Looking at this in the current situation, we expect to be able to close the year with a bottom-line growth of about 10 to 15% on an annualized basis. To conclude, we believe that India is emerging as a more significant player in the global chemical supply chain with its scalable low cost manufacturing ecosystem, improving infrastructure and established VHS compliance framework. The country is well positioned to expand its market share globally and there are also opportunities to replace import with domestic production. Investment into operational excellence and new product development can create differentiation and strong long-term business visibility. We are making several initiatives and investment to participate in this growing potential. On that note, I conclude my opening remarks. We would be very happy to give you our perspective on any questions that you may have. I request the operator on this call to open question and answer session. Moderator   \n",

       "4   I just wanted to check on the contract manufacturing capacities for the two of the large clients Œ when are they expected to get commissioned and when do you expect them to start running at full utilization? That was question number one. Secondly, the NCB capacities were impacted on two accounts Œ there was commissioning of the new capacities or expansion that is going on and Nitric Acid was also limited. Did this only impact the NCB and the downstream products or did it also impact other products? These are the two major questions that I have right now.
